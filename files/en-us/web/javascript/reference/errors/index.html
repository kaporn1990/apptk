<p>Below, you'll find a list of errors which are thrown by JavaScript. These errors can be a helpful debugging aid, but the reported problem isn't always immediately clear. The pages below will provide additional details about these errors. Each error is an object based upon the {{jsxref("Error")}} object, and has a <code>name</code> and a <code>message</code>.</p>

<p>Errors displayed in the Web console may include a link to the corresponding page below to help you quickly comprehend the problem in your code.</p>
